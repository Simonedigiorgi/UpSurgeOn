  description: The clavicle or collarbone is a long bone that serves as a strut between
    the shoulder blade and the sternum or breastbone. There are two clavicles, one
    on the left and one on the right. The clavicle is the only long bone in the body
    that lies horizontally. Together with the shoulder blade it makes up the shoulder
    girdle. It is a touchable bone and in people who have less fat in this region,
    the location of the bone is clearly visible, as it creates a bulge in the skin.
