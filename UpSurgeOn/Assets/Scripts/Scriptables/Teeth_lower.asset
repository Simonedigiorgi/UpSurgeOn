  description: 'The human teeth function to mechanically break down items of food
    by cutting and crushing them in preparation for swallowing and digesting. Humans
    have four types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, which each
    have a specific function. The incisors cut the food, the canines tear the food
    and the molars and premolars crush the food. The roots of teeth are embedded in
    the maxilla (upper jaw) or the mandible (lower jaw) and are covered by gums. Teeth
    are made of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness.'
